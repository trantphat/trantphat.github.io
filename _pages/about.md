I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by Prof. [Peter G. Jacobs](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/peter-g-jacobs) and Prof. [Lizhong Chen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~chenliz/). I am also affiliated with the [AIMS Lab](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/jacobs-lab) at [Oregon Health & Science University](https://www.ohsu.edu/). My research focuses on building reliable and interpretable AI systems for clinical healthcare by adapting language models to support medical decision-making.

Previously, I was fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Wooyoung Kim](https://faculty.washington.edu/kimw6/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) for my master's degree, and Prof. [Tho Quan](https://www.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/qttho) at [Ho Chi Minh University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/en) during my bachelor's degree.
